title: Alpine with pre-built applications
---

## Introduction

To simplify maintenance and distribution of the pre-built applications described in the QMTECH XC7Z020 notes, I've put together a bootable SD card image based on the lightweight [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org) distribution.

## Getting started

- Download [SD card image zip file]({{ site.release_image }}).
- Copy the contents of the SD card image zip file to a micro SD card.
- Optionally, to start one of the applications automatically at boot time, copy its `start.sh` file from `apps/<application>` to the topmost directory on the SD card.
- Install the micro SD card in the QMTECH XC7Z020 board and connect the power.
- Applications can be started from the web interface.

The default password for the `root` account is `changeme`.

## Network configuration

Wi-Fi is by default configured in hotspot mode with the network name (SSID) and password both set to `QMTECH XC7Z020`. When in hotspot mode, the IP address of the QMTECH XC7Z020 board is [192.168.42.1](http://192.168.42.1).

The wired interface is by default configured to request an IP address via DHCP. If no IP address is provided by a DHCP server, then the wired interface falls back to a static IP address [192.168.1.100](http://192.168.1.100).

The MAC address of the wired interface can be changed by editing the mac.txt file.

The configuration of the IP addresses is in [/etc/dhcpcd.conf](https://github.com/pavel-demin/qmtech-xc7z020-notes/blob/main/alpine/etc/dhcpcd.conf). More information about [/etc/dhcpcd.conf](https://github.com/pavel-demin/qmtech-xc7z020-notes/blob/main/alpine/etc/dhcpcd.conf) can be found at [this link](https://www.mankier.com/5/dhcpcd.conf).

From systems with enabled DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD), the QMTECH XC7Z020 board can be accessed as `sdr-a8xxxx.local`, where `a8xxxx` are the last 6 characters from the MAC address written on the Ethernet connector.

In the local networks with enabled local DNS, the QMTECH XC7Z020 board can also be accessed as `sdr-a8xxxx`.

## Useful commands

The [Alpine Wiki](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org) contains a lot of information about administrating [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org). The following is a list of some useful commands.

Switching to client Wi-Fi mode:

```bash
# configure WPA supplicant
wpa_passphrase SSID PASSPHRASE > /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

# configure services for client Wi-Fi mode
./wifi/client.sh

# save configuration changes to SD card
lbu commit -d
```

Switching to hotspot Wi-Fi mode:

```bash
# configure services for hotspot Wi-Fi mode
./wifi/hotspot.sh

# save configuration changes to SD card
lbu commit -d
```

Changing password:

```bash
passwd

lbu commit -d
```

Installing packages:

```bash
apk add python3

lbu commit -d
```

Editing a file:

```bash
# make SD card writable
rw

# edit start.sh
nano apps/sdr_receiver_hpsdr/start.sh

# make SD card read-only
ro
```
